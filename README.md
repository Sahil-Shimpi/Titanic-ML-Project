# Titanic-ML-Project

- In this project, I have tried my hands on the very famous "Titanic: Machine Learning through Disaster" challenge by Kaggle.
- I have analysed various factors which affected the survival rate of passengers of the legendary Titanic.
- Based on those factors, I have developed a predictive model achieving 95.40% accuracy.
- Various Data Analytics and Machine Learning Classification techniques have been used in Jupyter Notebook.
